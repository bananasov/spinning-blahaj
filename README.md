A spinning blue shark from ikea.

## Setting Up
To run this ridicously silly C project, you'll need [Xmake](https://xmake.io/)

```sh
# optionally, you can set to use the clang compiler instead
# you can read more about setting toolchains here: https://xmake.io/#/toolchain/builtin_toolchains
$ xmake f --cc=clang-cl --cxx=clang-cl -c
$ xmake -y
```

All built files will go into a directory called `build/`
